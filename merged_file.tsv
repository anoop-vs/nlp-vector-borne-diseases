in	O

an	O

we	O

an	O

that	O

We	O
analyze	O
the	O

that	O

Using	O
a	O

we	O
show	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
largely	O
owing	O
to	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O

that	O
it	O
is	O

that	O

a	O

that	O

We	O

result in considerable human morbidity and mortality. The continuous emergence and spread of new drug-resistant	I-Disease
strains is an obstacle to controlling and eliminating many	I-Disease
diseases	I-Disease
are ubiquitous enzymes essential for protein synthesis. The design and development of diverse small molecule, drug-like inhibitors against 	I-Disease
-encoded and expressed 	I-Disease
have validated this enzyme family as druggable. In this work, we have compiled the progress to date towards establishing the druggability of 	I-Disease
in terms of their biochemical characterization, validation as targets, inhibitor development, and structural interpretation from 	I-Disease
responsible for	I-Disease
and 	I-Disease
This work thus provides a robust framework for the systematic dissection of aaRSs from these pathogens and will facilitate the cross-usage of potential inhibitors to jump-start anti-parasite drug development.	I-Disease

脑型疟疾	O
CM	O
仍为非洲儿童死亡的一个常见原因	O
每年的死亡人数可达40万人	O
疟疾性视网膜病变为具有独特眼底体征的一系列改变	O
对CM具有诊断和预后价值	O
在临床工作中	O
对于疟疾性视网膜病变的评估已得到广泛应用	O
并常规纳入临床研究以完善入选标准	O
作为中枢神经系统中唯一肉眼可见的组织	O
视网膜提供了对这种寄生于红细胞的传染性小血管炎的病理生理学了解的有用信息	O

斑片状毛细血管无灌注很常见	O
并导致CM患者的视网膜缺血性改变	O
这些病理性改变可能反映在大脑中的病变	O
并导致在发育的随访中出现了明显的的全神经系统损伤	O
三种类型的血	O
视网膜屏障破坏是显而易见的	O
大面积病灶	O
点状病灶和血管渗漏	O
点状和大面积病灶渗漏	O
出血形成	O
与严重的脑组织肿胀和致命的临床解决有关	O
血管渗漏和毛细血管无灌注与中度脑组织肿胀和神经系统后遗症有关	O
这些发现意味着死亡和神经系统后遗症具有不同的机制	O
并不是严重后遗症的结局	O
每一次出血都会导致液体暂时不受控制地流出到组织中	O
多处病灶渗漏表明	O
出血的快速积累	O
是严重脑肿胀和死亡的可能机制	O
目前的研究旨在使用视盘OCT来识别严重脑水肿的患者	O
以及使用黄斑OCT来识别那些具有神经系统后遗症风险的患者	O
